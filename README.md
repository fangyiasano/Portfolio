# Fangyi's Portfolio 

## Project 1: Ski Resorts Data Analytics APP

* This application is designed to provide interactive visual analytics for ski resorts wordwide, integrating multiple metrics such as elevation, price, slope length, and snow cannons availability.

## Project 2: Building Automated Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow

* This project leverages Apache Airflow to automate and optimize the monitoring of ETL pipelines within a music streaming companyâ€™s data warehouse on Amazon Redshift. The goal is to create high-quality, dynamic data pipelines that facilitate effective monitoring, support seamless data backfilling, and enforce stringent data quality checks.

* Key operations include extracting JSON-formatted user activity logs and song metadata from S3, transforming this data into a structured format in Redshift, and performing comprehensive post-load quality checks to ensure data integrity and reliability.

## Project 3: AWS Data Lakehouse for Human Balance Analytics

* This project contains the implementation of a data lakehouse solution for the Step Trainer sensor data. The project focuses on using AWS services and Apache Spark to process and curate data from a motion-sensing device and a mobile app to train a machine learning model to detect steps accurately.

## Project 4: AWS Data Warehouse for Music Streaming Company

* This project entails building an ETL pipeline that extracts music streaming data from AWS S3, stages it in AWS Redshift, and transforms it into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team at Sparkify. This enables the team to gain insights into user activities on the music streaming app.

## Project 5: Predicting Real Estate Prices Using Machine Learning

* We developed a machine learning model to predict real estate prices, aimed at providing investors and real estate developers with a powerful tool to more accurately assess market risks and opportunities.
* By utilizing MIS and MIC scores, we identified the key factors influencing real estate prices and further validated the importance of these factors through machine learning model.
* We conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis, combining MIS, MIC scores, and the feature importance assessment from the machine learning model to select the most influential features. Additionally, we experimented with over a dozen different machine learning algorithms and optimized the model performance using Gridsearch and stacking techniques, ensuring the model provides the most accurate price predictions.
